# Wholesale App — Architecture Map

> **Current source-rights status, 2026-07-12.** This architecture includes
> legacy storage and operational pricing fields; their presence is not a
> publication grant. CardRush automated acquisition is hard-blocked by its
> official data policy and the absence of a formal partnership. TCGCollector
> is hard-blocked pending written partner approval. Stored CardRush prices,
> images, and history are withheld from public, signed-in, and bearer-token
> source-history surfaces. No source price is currently cleared for wholesale
> source publication. Authentication, storage, transformation, aggregation,
> and downstream contracts do not create upstream rights. The ECB daily
> reference-rate feed is the sole live FX input and must retain ECB attribution.

## 2. Auth Model

- **NextAuth v5** (beta 25) with **JWT strategy**, 30-day maxAge
- **Credentials provider** — email + password verified against `clients.password_hash` (bcryptjs)
- **Roles:** `admin` | `client` (from `clients.role` column, carried in JWT)
- **Brute-force protection:** In-memory rate limiter (5 attempts per email per 15 minutes)
- **Cookie config:** Production uses `__Secure-`/`__Host-` prefixed cookies on `.wholesaletcgdirect.com`
- **Middleware:**
  - Public: `/login`, `/api/auth/*`, `/api/v1/*`, `/api/cron/*`, `/api/webhooks/*`
  - Domain gating between admin/storefront subdomains
  - `/admin/*` requires `role === "admin"`, else redirect to `/catalog`
  - `/api/admin/*` requires `role === "admin"`, else 403
- **V1 API auth:** Separate system — Bearer token hashed with SHA-256, looked up in `channel_api_keys` table. Authentication controls who may call an endpoint; it does not create source acquisition or publication rights.

## 5. Pricing Engine

The formula below describes operational computation over inputs already held.
It does not authorize collection or publication of a source magnitude. Where a
price depends on uncleared CardRush lineage, source-price and derived-history
surfaces withhold it.

```
price = round((baseGbp × marginMultiplier + flatFee) × retailMultiplier × vatMultiplier, roundTo)
baseGbp = cardrushJpy / gbpJpyRate
```

| Channel | Margin | Flat Fee (singles/sealed) | VAT | Retail × | Round |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| wholesale | 1.08 | +0.22 / +2.20 | 1.20 | 1.0 | 0.01 |
| shopify | 1.08 | +0.22 / +2.20 | 1.20 | 1.15 | 0.10 |
| ebay | 1.08 | +0.22 / +2.20 | 1.20 | 1.25 | 0.10 |
| cardmarket | 1.08 | +0.22 / +2.20 | 1.20 | 1.20 | 0.01 |
| tradein-cash | 1.0 | 0 | 1.0 | 0.55 | 0.01 |
| tradein-credit | 1.0 | 0 | 1.0 | 0.77 | 0.01 |

Channel configs overridable from DB (`channel_pricing` table) with 5-min in-memory cache.

## 6. Data Flow

### Legacy Price Pipeline (disabled at the acquisition step)
```
price-snapshot → STOP: CardRush policy block before network access
legacy price_archive / price_history / cards → retained operational storage, not a public source grant
downstream computation → may run only for fields and uses with independently evidenced rights
```

### Order Flow
```
Client: /catalog → cart → /orders/new → POST /api/orders (status: submitted)
Admin:  stock-check → quoted → confirmed → paid → ordered → shipped → delivered
Emails sent at each transition via Resend
```

### Stock Derivation
```
stock = SUM(received purchases) - SUM(fulfillment entries) + SUM(stock adjustments)
pending_stock = SUM(ordered + shipped purchases)
```

### Multi-Channel Sales
- **Shopify:** Cron (every 30 min) + webhook (real-time) → create orders + decrement stock
- **eBay:** Import orders endpoint + inventory sync
- **External:** V1 sales API → decrement stock
- **Wholesale:** Web app order flow

---

## 7. Config

- **next.config.ts:** Empty (defaults)
- **drizzle.config.ts:** Schema at `src/lib/db/schema.ts`, output `./drizzle`
- **tailwind.config.ts:** Dark mode: class, custom brand colors (blue/indigo)
- **vercel.json:** one active cron definition (`monthly-rollover`); source acquisition jobs are not scheduled
- **middleware.ts:** Auth + domain gating + role enforcement
